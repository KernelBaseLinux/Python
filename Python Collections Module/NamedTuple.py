'''
A NamedTuple returns a tuple object with names for each position which the
ordinary tuples lack. For example, consider a tuple names student where
the first element represents fname, second represents lname and the third
element represents the DOB. Suppose for calling fname instead of remembering
the index position you can actually call the element by using the fname
argument, then it will be really easy for accessing tuples element.
This functionality is provided by the NamedTuple.

# Declaring namedtuple()

# Adding values 
S = Student('Nandini','19','2541997') 
    
# Access using index 
print ("The Student age using index is : ",end ="") 
print (S[1]) 
    
# Access using name  
print ("The Student name using keyname is : ",end ="") 
print (S.name)
